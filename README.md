## Setup
1. Install Python and Dependencies
First, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

Optional (Recommended): Create a Virtual Environment

```
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the Environment:
Windows:

```
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

macOS/Linux:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install Dependencies
With the environment activated (if using), install the required dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

in your terminal.

2. Run the Application
Execute the following command to start the application, replacing the name with the file you wish to execute:
